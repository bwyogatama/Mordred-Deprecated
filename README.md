Usage
----

*Dependencies:
```
Ubuntu > 20.04
GCC > 9.4
CUDA > 11.0
IntelTBB
```

To use Mordred:

To run the Star Schema Benchmark implementation:

* Generate the test dataset

```
cd test/

# Generate the test generator / transformer binaries
cd ssb/dbgen
make
cd ../loader
make 
cd ../../

# Generate the test data and transform into columnar layout
# Substitute <SF> with appropriate scale factor (eg: 1)
python util.py ssb <SF> gen
python util.py ssb <SF> transform

#Sort the LINEORDER table if you want to enable segment skipping
cd ssb/loader
make sort
./columnSort ../data/s{SF}_columnar/LINEORDER ../data/s{SF}_columnar/LINEORDERSORT 5 16 {COLUMN_SIZE}
```

* Configure the benchmark settings
```
# Edit SF and BASE_PATH in src/ssb/ssb_utils.h
# Edit SF and BASE_PATH in src/ssb/common.h
# Edit file path in src/ssb/minmax.cpp and src/ssb/minmaxsort.cpp
# Edit SF and table size in minmax.sh
```

* To compile and run Mordred
```
make setup
make bin/gpudb/minmax
make bin/gpudb/minmaxsort
./minmax.sh
make bin/gpudb/main
./bin/gpudb/main
```
